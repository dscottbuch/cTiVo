            <title>Version 2.5.1; H.264 and other major improvements</title>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <h2 id="release-2.5.1">Release 2.5.1 - 10.7 and 10.8</h1>

                <p>This version is only for systems using 10.7 or 10.8 as well as older Macs</p>
                <p>Due to the included binaries from other open-source efforts, it&rsquo;s getting much harder to support these older systems, but given the H.264 conversion, It has the older binaries (such as mencoder, ffmpeg, ccextractor etc) but otherwise should run fine.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>H.264 compatibility (new format for cable companies)</li>
                <li>Autodetects H.264 transition by channel</li>
                <li>Redesigned Formats (simpler, more compatible)</li>
                <li>New Channels preference screen</li>
                <li>Better handling for AC3 5.1 audio</li>
                <li>Many bug fixes</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="mpeg-4-transition">MPEG-4 Transition</h2>

                <p>Comcast and other cable companies are migrating from MPEG-2 compressed streams to MPEG-4 (aka H.264). They do this to reduce the size and improve the quality of their signals. Comcast seem to be rolling this out slowly, one market at a time and changing over one channel at a time. Although this transition requires many changes to cTiVo, they are transparent in normal operation, except that older Formats may be incompatible. With this release, we&rsquo;ve provided a whole new set of Formats, and taken the opportunity to make the Format selection process easier.</p>
